This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Python that leads to a ZeroDivisionError.  The function `function_with_uncommon_bug` attempts to handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero, but fails to explicitly handle the case where both are zero simultaneously. This results in an unexpected exception. The solution demonstrates proper error handling using a try-except block to avoid the ZeroDivisionError.
